todo list:
X - rough game loop
X - user input to progress story
X - simple vector of story events
0 - global game world state that can be set by a storyevent
0 - story graph, some edges predicated on global game state
0 - graph traversal with user input
0 - write story


global game world state:
state stored in hashmap of string to bool
do storyevents have mutable description that depends on world state somehow? Prob not
storyevents have a state prerequisite (needs to be checked before offering as a valid choice)
storyevents optionally have a statechange (str,bool tuple) that affects game state if activated.
